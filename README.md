API VERSIONING IN ASP.NET CORE Web API


API versioning is the practice of managing changes to an API and ensuring that these changes are made without disrupting clients. A good API versioning strategy communicates the changes made and allows API consumers to decide when to upgrade to the latest version at their own pace
API versioning is a technique used to manage changes to an API (Application Programming Interface) over time. An API is a set of rules and protocols that specifies how software components should interact with each other. As software evolves, changes may be necessary to the API, such as adding new functionality, modifying existing functionality, or removing deprecated functionality.

API versioning allows developers to make these changes to an API without breaking existing clients that depend on the API. It involves creating multiple versions of the API, with each version representing a specific set of functionality that is compatible with a specific client or set of clients.
